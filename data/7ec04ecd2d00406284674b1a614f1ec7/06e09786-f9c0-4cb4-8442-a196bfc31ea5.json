It regroups 9 metrics, with 1,273 questions from the US medical li-\n\tcense exams (MedQA), 500 questions from PubMed articles (PubMedQA), 4,183 questions\n\tfrom Indian medical entrance exams (MedMCQA), and 1,089 questions from 6 sub-cate-\n\tgories of MMLU (clinical knowledge, medical genetics, anatomy, professional medicine,\n\tcollege biology, and college medicine).\n\t- BigCodeBench Leaderboard: Evaluates the performance of code LLMs, featuring two main\n\tcategories: BigCodeBench-Complete for code completion based on structured docstrings,\n\tand BigCodeBench-Instruct for code generation from natural language instructions. Mod-\n\tels are ranked by their Pass@1 scores using greedy decoding, with an additional Elo rating\n\tfor the Complete variant. It covers a wide range of programming scenarios that test LLMs’\n\tcompositional reasoning and instruction-following capabilities.\n\t- Hallucinations Leaderboard: Evaluates LLMs’ tendency to produce false or unsupported\n\tinformation across 16 diverse tasks spanning 5 categories. These include Question Answer-\n\ting (with datasets like NQ Open, TruthfulQA, and SQuADv2), Reading Comprehension (using\n\tTriviaQA and RACE), Summarization (employing HaluEval Summ, XSum, and CNN/DM),\n\tDialogue (featuring HaluEval Dial and FaithDial), and Fact Checking (utilizing MemoTrap,\n\tSelfCheckGPT, FEVER, and TrueFalse). The leaderboard also assesses instruction-follow-\n\ting ability using IFEval.\n\t- Enterprise Scenarios Leaderboard: Evaluates the performance of LLMs on six real-world\n\tenterprise use cases, covering diverse tasks relevant to business applications. The bench-\n\tmarks include FinanceBench (100 financial questions with retrieved context), Legal Con-\n\tfidentiality (100 prompts from LegalBench for legal reasoning), Writing Prompts (cre-\n\tative writing evaluation), Customer Support Dialogue (relevance in customer service\n\tinteractions), Toxic Prompts (safety assessment for harmful content generation), and\n\tEnterprise PII (business safety for sensitive information protection). Some test sets are\n\tclosed-source to prevent gaming of the leaderboard. The evaluation focuses on specific\n\tcapabilities such as answer accuracy, legal reasoning, creative writing, contextual rele-\n\tvance, and safety measures, providing a comprehensive assessment of LLMs’ suitability\n\tfor enterprise environments.\n\n# Tools\n\n\t# LLMs\n\t\n\t[Link Preview](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness)\n\t[Link Preview](https://github.com/huggingface/lighteval)\n\t\n\t# RAG / Apps\n\t\n\t[https://aligneval.com/](https://aligneval.com/)\n\t[Link Preview](https://github.com/truera/trulens)\n\t[Link Preview](https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/ARES)",
